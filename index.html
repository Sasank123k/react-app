That's an excellent question. You've identified a key part of the user experience.
While you could make the frontend work without it, it's highly recommended to have an endpoint that gets all the initial data for a selected SOR.
Without it, when a user selects a SOR from the dropdown, the form fields would be blank. The user would have no idea what values (if any) are already stored in the database. They would be overwriting data blindly instead of editing it.
## The Best Solution: A Combined GET Endpoint
The most efficient solution is to have a single GET endpoint that fetches all the necessary data at once after the user makes a selection from the dropdown. This gives the user the current state of both the SOR and the App (if it exists).
Here is how you would implement this in the files we've already created.
1. Create a CombinedDetailsDto.java
This DTO will carry all the data needed to populate the form.
CombinedDetailsDto.java
package com.yourpackage.dto;

import com.yourpackage.model.App;
import com.yourpackage.model.Sor;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class CombinedDetailsDto {
    private Sor sorDetails;
    private App appDetails; // This will be null if an app record doesn't exist
}

2. Add the Logic to the Service
Add a new method to your service to fetch and combine the data.
BusinessApplicationOnboardingService.java (add this new method)
// Inside BusinessApplicationOnboardingService.java

// ... (existing methods) ...

/**
 * Fetches the existing details for a SOR and its corresponding App (if it exists).
 * This is used to populate the form for editing.
 */
public CombinedDetailsDto getOnboardingDetails(String name) {
    // Fetch the SOR details
    List<Sor> sors = sorRepository.findBySorName(name);
    if (sors.isEmpty()) {
        throw new RuntimeException("SOR not found: " + name);
    }
    Sor sor = sors.get(0);

    // Fetch the corresponding App details, if they exist
    List<App> apps = appRepository.findByApplicationName(name);
    App app = apps.isEmpty() ? null : apps.get(0);

    return new CombinedDetailsDto(sor, app);
}

3. Add the Endpoint to the Controller
Finally, add the new GET endpoint to your controller.
BusinessApplicationOnboardingController.java (add this new endpoint)
// Inside BusinessApplicationOnboardingController.java

// ... (existing endpoints for /sors/names and /apps/{appName}) ...

/**
 * Gets all existing SOR and App data to populate the form when a user selects a SOR.
 */
@GetMapping("/onboarding/{sorName}")
public ResponseEntity<CombinedDetailsDto> getOnboardingDetails(@PathVariable String sorName) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(onboardingService.getOnboardingDetails(sorName));
}

// ... (existing PUT mapping for /onboarding/{sorName}) ...

## Revised Workflow
With this change, your frontend workflow becomes much cleaner:
 * User selects "SOR_Beta" from the dropdown.
 * Frontend makes one call: GET /api/onboarding/SOR_Beta.
 * The response contains everything: the SOR details and the App details (or null).
 * The frontend populates all form fields with the existing data, ready for the user to edit.
 * The separate GET /api/apps/{appName} endpoint is no longer needed by the frontend workflow, as this single call provides all the necessary information.
