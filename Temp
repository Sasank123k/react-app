Below is the explanation and then the updated parts of the code (only for those sections that need to change):

### Explanation

Originally, our save handler was converting the internal JSON structure into the final JIL text (via convertToJILText) and sending that as the payload. However, now you want both representations stored in the backend. This means that when the user saves the file, the payload should include both:  
- The canonical JSON data (which is used by the editor on reload), and  
- The JIL text (which is generated using our conversion function).

The updated payload structure might look like this:

```json
{
  "jilFiles": [
    {
      "fileName": "FileName_From_Context",
      "jsonData": { ... },      // the full JSON object as maintained in the editor
      "content": "JIL formatted text ..."  // produced by convertToJILText
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The changes are focused on updating the handleSave function in the JILEditor.jsx file so that it constructs and sends this payload. Weâ€™ll use the previously extracted fileNames (from context) as before. Note that we must ensure that any hooks (including useContext) are only called at the top level, not within the save handler.

Please review the following updated version of the save handler (in JILEditor.jsx) as part of the final updated code. (Other portions of the file remain as in our previous update.)

### Updated HandleSave in JILEditor.jsx

Within JILEditor.jsx, update the save function so that the payload includes both jsonData and content. For example (explanatory comments included):

```jsx
const handleSave = () => {
  // At the top level, we already extracted fileNames from context.
  // Build a payload that includes both JSON (the canonical state) and
  // the converted JIL text.
  const payload = {
    jilFiles: jilFiles.map((file, idx) => ({
      fileName: fileNames[idx] || `File_${idx + 1}`,
      jsonData: file,  // Save the canonical JSON
      content: convertToJILText(file, metadata.definitions)  // Save the JIL formatted text
    }))
  };

  fetch(`${MICROSERVICE_URL}/api/jilData/${requirementId}`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      ...generateSearHeader(globalState),
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  })
    .then((res) => {
      if (!res.ok) {
        throw new Error("Save failed");
      }
      return res.json();
    })
    .then(() => {
      alert("JIL file saved successfully!");
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error("Error saving JIL file:", err);
    });
};
```

### Summary of Changes

- **Payload Structure:**  
  We now send both the JSON structure (in a field called `jsonData`) and the JIL formatted text (in `content`) for each file.  
- **No Hooks Inside Save:**  
  All hooks (like useContext, useAppGlobalState) continue to be called only at the top level, and the save handler uses the previously extracted values.  
- **Backend Consistency:**  
  With this payload, the backend will be able to store both representations. When fetching data, you can continue to expect the canonical JSON in `jsonData`.
